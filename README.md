# Github-Repo-listing-page
Designed a Website that displays the public Github repositories belonging to any specific user. There are 10 repositories per page, including loader. You can search users on the website's main page to the extreme right there is "Enter your Github Username" and then there is a "Go to Search Github Repositories" button where you can search specific user's Github Repositories. It will list 10 repositories per page. Also, in "index.html" I have created main page and "repo.index"- where you can search for the specific user's repositories on Github.
